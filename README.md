Color Stroop ( Cognitive assessment -> Attention -> Selective attention )


The Color Stroop Test is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. Also, the Stroop test can be used for measuring some extension of attention. 
Usually, it took longer for subjects to complete the task of naming the ink colors of words in comparison with naming the words.
In this version of the experiment, you are required to select the color of the word, not what the word says. For example, for the word, RED (printed in blue), you should say "Blue", as soon as the words appear on the screen.
